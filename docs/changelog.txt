Change Log for netLib Network Communication Library
---------------------------------------------------

v0.4 - 20070830
-major rework of how netBuffers are used. netBuffers can now store binary information that can be sent between different computer platforms (Endian issues)
-added netBufferAppendInt8, netBufferAppendInt16, netBufferAppendInt32, netBufferAppendString, netBufferAppendData, netBufferRemoveInt8, netBufferRemoveInt16, netBufferRemoveInt32, netBufferRemoveString, netBufferRemoveData, and netBufferClear functions.
-separate source files for netSockets (basic functions like connect, listen, accept, send, receive, etc.) and netBuffers (sendbuffer, recvbuffer, appends, removes)
-Thanks to Brad Fewster for offering tips on a few parts of netLib. "if" statements were altered as well as variable passing to some functions based on his advice
-added netSetOption function
-found the command line option to allow for correct functionality in BeOS BONE
-miscellaneous cleanup of code

v0.3 - 20070626
-fixed bug in netConnect on Unix. setsockint was not declared as a variable
-disable the Nagle algorithm by default in netConnect and netAccept
-changed all library messages to print to stderr instead of stdout
-added a return value to the netSocket structure. netSock->retval will contain the return value of the last netLib fuction that was called on it
-added a complete value to the netBuffer structure. netBuff->complete will contain 1 if the whole buffer has been sent/received
-change to netRecvBuffer so we can not get stuck waiting for more data
-fixed an issue with netIsSocketWaiting as it was not interpreting the return value propery
-renamed netIsSocketWaiting to netIsDataPending. The function name is a bit clearer now
-removed netSelect function. Should be using netIsDataPending instead
-added a chat demo
-miscellaneous cleanup of code

v0.2 - 20070424
-use errno values from operating system
-added timeout value to netSocket structure
-added netIsSocketWaiting function, quick version of netSelect
-added netSetTimeout function to set timeout on a netSocket
-change: netRecv, netRecvBuffer, and netAccept use netIsSocketWaiting
-added global verbose option for library
-bug fix in netListen. Internal call to setsockopt was not working correctly in Windows
-fixed a small bug in netSendBuffer and netRecvBuffer. At was not being reset in the case of a failed transfer
-fixed an issue on linux when doing a send(). In v0.1 SIGPIPE was still being tripped. Tested with Ubuntu 7.04
-added SIGPIPE protection in netConnect for Mac OS X
-miscellaneous cleanup of code

v0.1 - 20070227
-Initial public release
